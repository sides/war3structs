war3structs
-----------------

Python construct definitions for Warcraft III file formats.

The scope of this project has changed into more or less just being a
toolset for manipulating WC3 data and providing parsing of the observer
API, rather than for manipulating maps. I'm not sure how many of the
structs are relevant anymore.
