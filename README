war3structs
-----------------

Python construct definitions for Warcraft III file formats.


Usage
-----------------

Structures are located in war3structs/ and come with full structures
for files themselves (inside e.g. a map archive). Example:

  >>> from war3structs import CamerasFile
  >>> with open("./war3map.w3c", "rb") as data:
  ...   cameras = CamerasFile.parse_stream(data)
  ...   print(cameras)
  ...
  Container:
      version = 0
      cameras_count = 1
      cameras = ListContainer:
          Container:
              target_x = 100
              target_y = 100
              offset_z = 0.0
              rotation = 90.0
              angle_of_attack = 304.0
              distance = 2000.0
              roll = 0.0
              field_of_view = 70.0
              far_clipping = 5000.0
              name = u'myCamera' (total 8)

Files are Structs and come with parsing and building options as per the
construct package.

Status
-----------------

The formats are loosely tested or barely tested at all, especially as
far as building goes. It also currently only supports formats inside
map archives, not the other pack formats such as artificial
intelligence, campaign and replay files.

I also believe it to be likely that these formats will be updated for
Warcraft 3 Reforged. So, TODO: Add some interface to work with
different patches. A patch will use different data as far as
TriggerData.txt goes (triggers) and as far as the versions of the
formats go. Alternatively don't bother with this at all and just keep
the formats updated to the latest patch (fingers crossed for official
docs) and let people worry about using the correctly tagged release on
git depending on their specs.
