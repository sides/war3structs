war3structs
-----------------

Python construct definitions for Warcraft III file formats.


Usage
-----------------

Structures are located in war3structs/ and come with full structures
for files themselves (inside e.g. a map archive). Example:

  >>> from war3structs import CamerasFile
  >>> with open("./war3map.w3c", "rb") as data:
  ...   cameras = CamerasFile.parse_stream(data)
  ...   print(cameras)
  ...
  Container:
      version = 0
      cameras_count = 1
      cameras = ListContainer:
          Container:
              target_x = 100
              target_y = 100
              offset_z = 0.0
              rotation = 90.0
              angle_of_attack = 304.0
              distance = 2000.0
              roll = 0.0
              field_of_view = 70.0
              far_clipping = 5000.0
              name = u'myCamera' (total 8)

Files are Structs and come with parsing and building options as per the
construct package.
